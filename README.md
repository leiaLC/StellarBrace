## EMG-Controlled Robotic Elbow Orthosis
This project implements a robotic orthosis to assist elbow flexion in individuals with motor limitations (e.g., age-related muscle weakness). The system uses EMG signals to detect muscle activity and triggers actuation via a microcontroller. Developed during Tec de Monterrey’s BioHack 2023 (1st place in Bioinstrumentation), it integrates:

    EMG signal acquisition (filtering, amplification)

    Embedded control (Arduino/STM32)

    3D-printed mechanical design (ergonomic, lightweight)

    Real-time responsiveness testing

Designed as a TRL2 prototype, the orthosis demonstrates proof-of-concept for low-cost assistive mobility solutions.
Key Features:

✅ Hardware: Custom PCB for EMG processing (or off-the-shelf modules like MyoWare)

✅ Software: Signal thresholding, safety controls

✅ Design: Fusion 360/SolidWorks, biomechanical optimization
